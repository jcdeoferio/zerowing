This solution aims to enable the partial replication of databases. This addresses the problem of sites that frequently get disconnected from each other. Sites can choose which subset of data is stored in their databases through the use of filters and metadata information. Disconnected operation is enabled by having the sites store the data locally and send changes to other sites during synchronization. Synchronizing is peer-to-peer: data generated at one site can be synchronized with any other site.
